# Fixing SSL/HTTPS Connection Issues in Local Development

## Problem
You're seeing SSL/HTTPS connection errors in the browser console when running CashPilot locally. This happens because the browser is trying to load resources over HTTPS instead of HTTP.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Updated `next.config.ts` to disable HTTPS redirects in development
2. ✅ Modified `src/middleware.ts` to use development-friendly security headers
3. ✅ Cleared Next.js build cache (`.next` folder)
4. ✅ Restarted development server

## Manual Steps (if issues persist)

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac)
- Select "All time" and clear all cache

### 2. Hard Refresh
- **Windows**: Press `Ctrl+F5`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R`

### 3. Clear Browser Data for localhost
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 4. Check URL
- Make sure you're accessing: `http://localhost:3001` (not `https://localhost:3001`)
- If you see HTTPS, manually change it to HTTP

### 5. Disable Browser Security Features (Temporary)
- **Chrome**: Add `--disable-web-security --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome_dev_session` to launch flags
- **Firefox**: Set `security.mixed_content.block_active_content` to `false` in about:config

## Expected Result
After these changes, you should see:
- ✅ No SSL/HTTPS errors in console
- ✅ All resources loading properly over HTTP
- ✅ Application running smoothly on `http://localhost:3001`

## If Issues Continue
1. Try a different browser
2. Check if any browser extensions are interfering
3. Restart your computer
4. Contact support if the problem persists
