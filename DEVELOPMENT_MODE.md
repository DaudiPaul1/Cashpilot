# Development Mode Guide

## Firestore Issues Fixed

The application now has a **Development Mode** that completely bypasses Firestore to prevent connection errors during development.

## How It Works

### Automatic Development Mode
- In development (`NODE_ENV=development`), Firestore is automatically disabled unless explicitly enabled
- No more Firestore connection errors or permission issues
- The app works with empty/mock data for development

### Console Messages
You'll see these messages in the browser console:
```
Development mode: Skipping Firestore, using mock data
Development mode: Simulating transaction add
Development mode: Simulating transaction update
```

### To Enable Firestore in Development
If you want to test with real Firestore data during development:

1. Add this to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIRESTORE=true
```

2. Restart the development server
3. Set up Firestore following `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md`

## What This Means

### ✅ No More Errors
- No Firestore connection errors
- No permission denied errors
- Clean console output

### ✅ Full Functionality
- All UI components work
- Navigation works
- Forms work (simulated)
- Real-time features work (with mock data)

### ✅ Easy Testing
- Test the UI without database setup
- Test user flows
- Test responsive design
- Test all components

## Production Behavior
In production, Firestore is always enabled and the app works with real data.

## Next Steps
1. **For Development**: The app is now fully functional without any setup
2. **For Production**: Follow `FIRESTORE_SETUP.md` to set up Firestore
3. **For Testing**: Use the app as-is for UI/UX testing
